# Secret Message

## Prerequisites
Strings; Arrays

## Problem
Write a loop to print out every third character in the following code, to uncover the hidden message. You may include any additional libraries beyond those provided for in the distribution code, if you would like.

## Distribution Code
```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    // hidden message to decode
    string s = "asTJhhJKikJswe hkij;sop /bCurSN;5PK0es";

    // TODO: write a while loop to print every third character in the string, and uncover the hidden message
    return 0;
}
```
