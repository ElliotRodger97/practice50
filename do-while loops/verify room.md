# Verify Room Input

## Prerequisites
ASCII

## Problem
The user is filling out their room info on a form. Rooms are identified by a capital letter between A and G, followed by an integer between 1 and 20. Using a Do-While loop, prompt the user for both the letter and number, and the condition to verify the input is within the possible ranges. (Hint: Use an ASCII table for bounding the range of letters!)
