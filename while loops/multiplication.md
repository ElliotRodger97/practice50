## Prerequisites
None

## Problem
Imagine that the only mathematical operation available to you is addition. Take two integers, `x` and `y`, as input -- and use a `while` loop to find and print their product (hint: remember that adding `y` to itself `x` times is the same as adding `x` to itself `y` times).
